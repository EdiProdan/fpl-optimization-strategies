# fpl-optimization-strategies

## Description
The "fpl-optimization-strategies" repository is a comprehensive solution for optimizing Fantasy Premier League (FPL) teams for a given gameweek. FPL enthusiasts and data-driven fantasy football managers can leverage three powerful optimization algorithms implemented in this repository: Greedy, GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) with Tabu Search, and Simulated Annealing.

### Key Features
1. **Greedy Algorithm:** A straightforward, greedy approach to team optimization, making locally optimal choices at each step to build a competitive FPL squad.

2. **GRASP with Tabu Search:** The GRASP algorithm combines greedy construction with local search, enhanced by a Tabu Search mechanism to escape local optima. This ensures a more globally optimized FPL team.

3. **Simulated Annealing:** Inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, this algorithm introduces randomness to explore a wider solution space. The temperature parameter controls the acceptance of suboptimal solutions, allowing the algorithm to escape local minima and discover better team compositions.
